# Phase 4 — RDAP verification: design

**Status:** ✅ **BUILT 2026-07-15** (brainstorm 2026-07-14 + owner spec review round 1). Ready for
writing-plans. Review round 1 landed: dropped-feed rows verify first in `select_due`; `GRACE_EST_DAYS`
pinned to 45 with a documented hard floor of 35 (self-review number corrected); `pending restore` and
hold-without-RGP kept OPEN (owner decisions); whodap non-429 exception types verified and wired into the
backoff retry set; dead `[rdap.recheck_days] expiring` key removed; unmatched-status tally added; `--domain`
restricted to open-row writes. Parent design: `docs/TECHNICAL-DESIGN.md` §4.4 (RDAP verification), §5
(open-cycle schema). Builds on the Phase-2 truststore `httpx` client pattern and the Phase-3 `filter_pass` gate.

**Goal:** For each open, rules-filter-surviving candidate, ask Verisign RDAP what state the domain is in,
and translate that into our open-cycle model: set `lifecycle_status`, a **status-driven** `drop_date_est`,
`expiry_date`, the raw `rdap_status`, and `verified_at`. Re-verify open rows on a per-status cadence so a
confirmed drop (404) flips a row to `dropped` (available now, still OPEN) and a later re-registration (200)
closes the cycle as `reregistered`. Async, self-rate-limited, idempotent, TLS-through-the-OS-trust-store.

---

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Async RDAP lookup against **`rdap.verisign.com/com/v1/` directly** (never the rdap.org aggregator) via
  `whodap` (async, MIT), injecting our own truststore `httpx.AsyncClient`.
- **Status-driven drop-date** computation (redemption +35 d, pendingDelete +5 d; auto-renew grace low-confidence).
- **Open-cycle lifecycle transitions** — the §5 closure logic (`dropped`→`reregistered`, lapsing→`renewed`,
  404→`dropped`), plus keep-OPEN handling of `pending restore` and hold-without-RGP, as a **pure** function.
- Our own **rate-limiter** (token bucket at `rdap_max_rps`) + **concurrency** semaphore + **backoff** on
  429 / 5xx / network-timeout (`RateLimitError`, `BadStatusCode`, `httpx.TransportError`).
- **Re-verify cadence** keyed on `verified_at` and current status; per-run politeness cap (`--limit`, default 1000).
- **DoH resolution probe** (Cloudflare `1.1.1.1` JSON API) recorded to a new `dns_status` column — **signal only**.
- Persist `lifecycle_status`, `rdap_status`, `expiry_date`, `drop_date_est`, `drop_date_actual`, `dns_status`,
  `verified_at`. Add `dns_status` via the single-authority migration.
- `verify` CLI (idempotent; `--limit`, `--concurrency`, `--recheck-all`, `--domain`, `--dry-run`).
- `whodap` as the 4th runtime dependency.

**Out of scope (deferred):**
- AI scoring / toxicity / comps → Phase 5. Verify never touches `tier1_score`/`tier2_scores`/…
- **DoH as a gate.** NXDOMAIN can't safely mean "available" for .com (redemption/pendingDelete domains are
  removed from the zone yet still registered), so DoH never short-circuits an RDAP call or sets
  `lifecycle_status` this phase — it is recorded for later analysis only.
- IANA bootstrap discovery across TLDs — we're .com-only with one known endpoint, so we **preset** the
  `.com`→Verisign mapping and skip the bootstrap network call entirely.
- Backorder/auction actions on the computed drop dates → later phases.
- **Auto-dismissing stale `dropped` rows.** A `dropped`/available row re-verifies weekly forever until it is
  reregistered or dismissed — an unbounded but slow-growing set. Fine for now; **parked as a Phase-6/8
  candidate** ("auto-dismiss `dropped` rows older than N days") so it lives somewhere instead of drifting.

---

## Locked decisions (from this brainstorm)

1. **`whodap` client, truststore-injected, bootstrap skipped.** `whodap` (async, MIT) as documented in §4.4.
   Its `DNSClient`/`aio_lookup_domain` accept a pre-built `httpx.AsyncClient`, so we pass our
   `truststore.SSLContext` client (the AV/proxy MITM handling proven in Phase 2). We **preset**
   `DNSClient.iana_dns_server_map = {"com": <endpoint>}` from `criteria.rdap_endpoint` and never call the IANA
   bootstrap (`new_aio_client` would fetch `data.iana.org/rdap/dns.json` on every construction).
2. **Verify scope = open **AND** `filter_pass = 1`, cap `--limit 1000`/run.** RDAP calls are only spent on rows
   that survived Phase 3, ordered by drop-date proximity then staleness. The first run's ~3.5 k backlog drains
   over a few daily runs; the truncation is logged, not silent.
3. **Two modules: `rdap.py` (async I/O) + `lifecycle.py` (pure).** The auditable domain logic — the transition
   table and the drop-date math — lives in a network-free module tested entirely on fixtures.
4. **DoH = recorded signal only.** A cheap Cloudflare DoH A-record probe runs alongside RDAP and stores
   `noerror`/`nxdomain`/`servfail`/`error` in `dns_status`. It never gates an RDAP call and never influences
   `lifecycle_status` — RDAP is the sole source of lifecycle truth.

### whodap gotchas (verified against whodap 0.1.16 — captured so the plan doesn't rediscover them)

- **`DNSClient` is stateful (`self._target`)** — it is mutated per call and read while following related
  hrefs, so **one `DNSClient` instance cannot serve concurrent `aio_lookup` calls.** We use **one client per
  concurrent worker**, all sharing the single `httpx.AsyncClient` (which *is* concurrency-safe).
- **`aio_lookup_domain(...)` bootstraps IANA per call** (via `new_aio_client`) → never call it in the loop.
- **404 → `whodap.errors.NotFoundError`** (raised at recursion depth 0) — this is our "available" signal.
  **429 → `whodap.errors.RateLimitError`** — our backoff trigger.
- **Other failures (verified in `_check_status_code` / `_aio_get_request`, 0.1.16):** **5xx → `BadStatusCode`**,
  400 → `MalformedQueryError` (both subclass `WhodapError`); and `_aio_get_request` does **not** wrap httpx, so
  **network/timeout errors propagate raw** as `httpx.TransportError` subclasses (`ConnectError`, `ReadTimeout`,
  …). So `with_backoff` retries `(RateLimitError, BadStatusCode, httpx.TransportError)`; `NotFoundError` is a
  valid result (never retried), and `MalformedQueryError` (a bad query — won't fix on retry) goes straight to
  the per-row `errors` bucket.
- **`DomainResponse`** exposes `.status` (`list[str]`) and `.events` (objects with `.eventAction: str` and
  `.eventDate: datetime`, already parsed). Constructible from fixture JSON via `DomainResponse.from_json(b)`
  → the parse path is fully unit-testable with **no network**.

```

### Pure core — `lifecycle.py` (no I/O; the auditable heart)

```python
@dataclass
class LifecycleUpdate:
    lifecycle_status: str
    drop_date_est: date | None
    drop_date_actual: date | None    # today on a confirmed drop; writer COALESCE-preserves the first one
    expiry_date: date | None

REDEMPTION_TAIL_DAYS = 35            # ICANN RGP redemption 30 d + pendingDelete 5 d
PENDING_DELETE_DAYS  = 5
GRACE_EST_DAYS       = 45            # low-confidence, anchored on TODAY (see note): rough days-to-drop while
                                     # in the registrar-variable auto-renew grace; refined on recheck.
                                     # HARD FLOOR 35: an autoRenewPeriod domain CANNOT drop sooner than the
                                     # fixed 35 d redemption+pendingDelete tail — never tune below 35.

# RDAP status strings we act on (lowercased), checked in next_state's documented order.
S_PENDING_DELETE  = "pending delete"
S_REDEMPTION      = "redemption period"
S_PENDING_RESTORE = "pending restore"                 # filed restore during redemption -> keep OPEN as redemption
S_AUTO_RENEW      = "auto renew period"
S_HOLDS           = ("client hold", "server hold")    # hold + no RGP -> keep OPEN as grace (NOT a closure)

# Statuses we understand (decision-relevant + expected registry noise). Anything OUTSIDE this set is
# tallied as "unmatched" in the run summary, so real-data confirmation surfaces novel Verisign strings
# as a number instead of as silently-closed rows.
KNOWN_STATUSES = frozenset({
    S_PENDING_DELETE, S_REDEMPTION, S_PENDING_RESTORE, S_AUTO_RENEW, *S_HOLDS,
    "active", "ok", "inactive",
    "client transfer prohibited", "server transfer prohibited",
    "client delete prohibited",   "server delete prohibited",
    "client update prohibited",   "server update prohibited",
    "client renew prohibited",    "server renew prohibited",
})

def next_state(current: str, obs: "RdapObservation", today: date) -> LifecycleUpdate: ...

def unmatched_statuses(obs: "RdapObservation") -> tuple[str, ...]:
    """Status strings not in KNOWN_STATUSES — counted per-run to catch registry surprises empirically."""
    return tuple(s for s in obs.status if s not in KNOWN_STATUSES)
```

**Transition table** (`current` = the row's existing `lifecycle_status`; **first matching row wins**, top-to-bottom):

| # | condition | → `lifecycle_status` | `drop_date_est` | cycle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `obs.available` (RDAP 404) | `dropped` | cleared; sets `drop_date_actual = today` | **stays OPEN** — the live hand-register opportunity |
| 2 | registered, `pending delete` | `pending_delete` | `pd_event or today` **+ 5 d** | open (highest confidence) |
| 3 | registered, `redemption period` **or** `pending restore` | `redemption` | `rp_event or today` **+ 35 d** | open (pending-restore kept OPEN one more cadence → catches a *failed* restore) |
| 4 | registered, `auto renew period` | `grace` | `today + 45 d` (low conf.) | open |
| 5 | registered, **`current == 'dropped'`** (no RGP row above matched) | `reregistered` | cleared | **CLOSES** — someone re-registered (catches re-reg even if the new reg is on hold) |
| 6 | registered, `client hold`/`server hold` (no RGP above; `current != 'dropped'`) | `grace` | `today + 45 d` (low conf.) | open — mid-expiry-flow park, **not** a closure |
| 7 | registered, otherwise (any other open `current`) | `renewed` | cleared | **CLOSES** — recovered/renewed |

Notes:
- **Row order matters.** RGP statuses (rows 2–4) reflect the domain's *current* registry position and win
  regardless of prior state. Row 5 (`current == 'dropped'` → `reregistered`) sits **before** the hold row so a
  dropped-then-re-registered domain closes as `reregistered` even when the new registration is parked on hold;
  row 6 (hold → `grace`) therefore only fires for a *non-dropped* current, i.e. a domain mid-expiry-flow.
- **`pending restore` is kept OPEN as `redemption`** (owner decision, 2026-07-15). A filed restore usually
  completes — the next verify then shows the domain active → closes as `renewed`. But a *failed* restore falls
  back to redemption → pendingDelete → drops, and a premature `renewed` closure can't reopen until the feed
  resurfaces the name, so we watch one more cadence. Matched explicitly, never a silent fall-through.
- **`client hold`/`server hold` with no RGP status → `grace` (OPEN), not a closure** (owner decision,
  2026-07-15). Some registrars park expired-in-grace domains on hold before the RGP statuses appear; closing
  those as `renewed` would forfeit the opportunity window. Kept OPEN with a low-confidence estimate and
  re-checked; if it later goes plainly active it closes as `renewed` then.
- **Unmatched statuses are counted, never silently closed.** Any status string outside `KNOWN_STATUSES`
  (`lifecycle.unmatched_statuses`) is tallied into the run summary. A domain whose *only* actionable signal is
  an unknown string still resolves via rows 5/7 (its `current`), but the tally makes novel Verisign strings
  visible as a number for real-data confirmation #2.
- **Event dates preferred when present** (§4.4): if the RDAP `events` array carries a `redemption period` /
  `pending delete` action date, anchor the offset on it; Verisign usually omits these, so we fall back to
  `today` (observation date) — a conservative upper bound on the true drop.
- `expiry_date` is taken from the `expiration` event on every registered response (stored as-is).
- **`grace` anchors its estimate on `today`, not `expiry`.** During the auto-renew grace, Verisign has
  already auto-renewed the registry `expiration` **+1 year**, so `expiry` is ~13 months out and useless for the
  drop date. The real drop path from grace is: grace (0–45 d, registrar-variable) → redemption (30 d) →
  pendingDelete (5 d). We can't see remaining grace, so `today + 45 d` is a deliberately rough low-confidence
  placeholder that gets **refined** the moment the row is re-verified into `redemption`/`pending_delete`
  (which then anchor precisely). Same reason `pending_delete`/`redemption` anchor on `today`, not `expiry`.
- **`drop_date_actual`** is returned as `today` only on a 404. The DB writer sets it with
  `COALESCE(drop_date_actual, :actual)`, so the **first** confirmed-drop date sticks and is retained even after
  the cycle later closes as `reregistered` (this non-null history is §5's prior-drop-count quality signal).
- **Why "plain registered from a fresh `unknown`" closes as `renewed`:** the feed is a list of *expired/dropped*
  names; a name RDAP reports as plainly registered with no RGP tail (and no hold) has recovered, so it is not a
  live opportunity. Closing retains it as history and (via the partial unique index) frees a future feed
  appearance to open a fresh cycle.
- **`expiring` is not emitted by Phase 4.** RDAP always gives us the more specific
  `grace`/`redemption`/`pending_delete`/`dropped`, so no transition produces `expiring`. It stays a valid
  `OPEN_STATUS` in the enum only for forward-compat; its dead `[rdap.recheck_days] expiring` cadence key is
  therefore **removed** (a valid-but-unreachable config knob is a future-you trap). If some later path ever sets
  `expiring`, `_is_due`'s missing-key fallback (0 days ⇒ always due) handles it safely.

**Cadence** (pure): `_is_due(status, verified_at, now, recheck_days) -> bool` — `True` if `verified_at is None`
or `now - verified_at >= recheck_days[status]` (an `unknown`/missing entry ⇒ 0 days ⇒ always due).

### RDAP I/O — `rdap.py`

```python
@dataclass
class RdapObservation:
    available: bool                  # True iff RDAP 404 / NotFoundError
    status: tuple[str, ...]          # normalized (lowercased) RDAP status list
    events: dict[str, date]          # eventAction(lower) -> date
    expiry_date: date | None
    status_json: str                 # json.dumps(list(status)) -> the rdap_status column

@dataclass
class VerifyCounts:                  # (lives in models.py) — the printed run summary
    processed: int = 0
    dropped: int = 0; redemption: int = 0; pending_delete: int = 0; grace: int = 0
    renewed: int = 0; reregistered: int = 0
    errors: int = 0                  # per-row failures after backoff (skipped, never abort the batch)
    left_for_next_run: int = 0       # due backlog beyond --limit (logged, not silent)
    unmatched: "dict[str, int]" = field(default_factory=dict)  # unknown status string -> count

def parse_observation(resp: "DomainResponse | None") -> RdapObservation:
    # resp is None for a 404 (NotFoundError caught in lookup_one)
    ...

def make_async_client(criteria) -> httpx.AsyncClient:
    # async twin of ingest.make_client: truststore.SSLContext, follow_redirects=True,
    # timeout=criteria.rdap_timeout, headers={"User-Agent": criteria.rdap_user_agent}

async def lookup_one(dns_client, label: str) -> RdapObservation:
    # dns_client.aio_lookup(label, "com"); on NotFoundError -> available; RateLimitError bubbles to backoff

async def verify_candidates(conn, criteria, *, limit=1000, concurrency=None,
                            recheck_all=False, dry_run=False, now=None,
                            lookup=lookup_one, doh=doh.probe) -> VerifyCounts:
    # 1) select_due(conn, criteria, now, recheck_all, limit) -> rows
    # 2) shared httpx.AsyncClient + pool of `concurrency` DNSClients (map preset, no bootstrap)
    # 3) per row under semaphore + TokenBucket(rdap_max_rps):
    #       obs   = await backoff(lambda: lookup(client, label))   # retries RateLimitError/5xx
    #       dns   = await doh(http_client, domain)                 # recorded only; never gates
    #       upd   = lifecycle.next_state(row.lifecycle_status, obs, now)
    #       if not dry_run: db.set_rdap_result(conn, row.id, ...upd..., rdap_status=obs.status_json,
    #                                           dns_status=dns, verified_at=now)
    # 4) tally VerifyCounts; log() when the backlog exceeds `limit`
```

- **`lookup`/`doh` are injected** (defaults are the real network fns) so the orchestrator is tested with fakes,
  **zero network** in the suite.
- **DB writes are synchronous** `sqlite3` calls interleaved between `await`s — safe because the whole phase runs
  single-threaded under one `asyncio` event loop (the CLI handler calls `asyncio.run(verify_candidates(...))`).
- **Per-row failures** (unexpected RDAP/DoH errors after retries) are logged and counted as `errors`, then
  skipped — one bad domain never aborts the batch.

`select_due(conn, criteria, now, recheck_all, limit)` runs:
```sql
SELECT id, domain, feed_category, lifecycle_status, drop_date_actual, verified_at
FROM candidates
WHERE lifecycle_status NOT IN ('renewed','reregistered','dismissed')   -- open
  AND filter_pass = 1                                                  -- Phase-3 survivors only
ORDER BY (feed_category = 'dropped') DESC,        -- dropped-feed rows may be hand-registerable NOW -> first
         (drop_date_est IS NULL), drop_date_est ASC,
         (verified_at IS NULL) DESC, verified_at ASC
```
then keeps rows where `recheck_all or lifecycle._is_due(status, verified_at, now, criteria.rdap_recheck_days)`,
taking the first `limit`. (Cadence is applied in Python for clarity/testability.)

**Dropped-feed rows verify first** (restores a Phase-3-era agreement, TDD §4.4). A `feed_category='dropped'`
row is a name the feed already flagged as dropped, so it may be **available for hand-registration right now** —
and since ingestion no longer stamps `lifecycle_status`, RDAP is the only thing that can reveal that open
window. On the first backlog-draining runs *every* row has `drop_date_est IS NULL`, so without this term the
most time-sensitive rows would sit undifferentiated in a ~3.5 k queue at 1 rps and could wait days. One
`ORDER BY` term is the difference between noticing an available gem today vs. after it's gone. Once estimates
exist, soonest-dropping rows sort next within each feed group.

### Rate-limit / backoff — `ratelimit.py`

- `class TokenBucket: def __init__(self, rate: float); async def acquire(self) -> None` — refills at `rate`
  tokens/sec (capacity 1); `rdap_max_rps` (default **1.0**) is the real throughput throttle.
- `async def with_backoff(coro_factory, *, retries, base=2.0, cap=60.0, sleep=asyncio.sleep)` — retries the
  **`RETRYABLE = (RateLimitError, BadStatusCode, httpx.TransportError)`** tuple (429 / 5xx / network+timeout)
  with exponential delay (`min(cap, base * 2**n)`), giving up after `retries` → the caller counts it as an
  `error`. `NotFoundError` and `MalformedQueryError` are **not** retryable (the former is the available-signal,
  handled in `lookup_one`; the latter won't fix on retry). `sleep` is injected so tests use a fake clock. The
  concurrency **semaphore** (default 5) bounds simultaneous sockets; with 1 rps it mostly overlaps latency —
  raising `rdap_max_rps` is what actually speeds a run.

### DoH probe — `doh.py`

```python
DOH_URL = "https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query"     # JSON API; Accept: application/dns-json
async def probe(http_client, domain: str) -> str:    # -> "noerror" | "nxdomain" | "servfail" | "error"
    # GET DOH_URL?name={domain}&type=A ; map response "Status": 0->noerror, 3->nxdomain, 2->servfail; any exc->error
```
Reuses the shared truststore `httpx.AsyncClient`. Errors are swallowed to `"error"` — DoH never aborts a row.

---

## Schema changes (`db.py`) — single-authority migration

Every RDAP column already exists from Phase 1 (`expiry_date`, `drop_date_est`, `drop_date_actual`,
`lifecycle_status`, `rdap_status`, `verified_at`). Phase 4 adds **one** new column:

| column | type | note |
|--------|------|------|
| `dns_status` | TEXT | DoH A-probe result: `noerror`/`nxdomain`/`servfail`/`error` — recorded signal, never gates |

Both paths converge (identical to the Phase-3 mechanism): `dns_status` is in the `CREATE TABLE` DDL for fresh
DBs and appended to `_MIGRATION_COLUMNS` for existing DBs, so `init_db`'s idempotent `_migrate` (PRAGMA-guarded
`ALTER TABLE`) adds it. `init_db` stays the single schema authority; `verify` assumes `init-db` was run.

```python
def set_rdap_result(conn, candidate_id, *, lifecycle_status, rdap_status, expiry_date,
                    drop_date_est, drop_date_actual, dns_status, verified_at) -> None:
    # UPDATE candidates SET lifecycle_status=?, rdap_status=?, expiry_date=?, drop_date_est=?,
    #        drop_date_actual = COALESCE(drop_date_actual, ?),   -- first confirmed drop sticks
    #        dns_status=?, verified_at=?  WHERE id=?
```
Touches only the RDAP/DoH columns — never `filter_*`, `source`, `first_seen`, or scoring columns.

---

## CLI

```
python -m domainscout verify [--criteria criteria.toml] [--limit 1000] [--concurrency 5]
                             [--recheck-all] [--domain NAME] [--dry-run] [--db data/domainscout.db]
```
- Default: verify due open+`filter_pass` rows, newest-drop / stalest first, up to `--limit`.
- `--recheck-all` ignores the cadence (re-verify every open+filter_pass row up to `--limit`).
- `--domain NAME` — one live lookup; print the parsed observation + computed `LifecycleUpdate` (debug path).
  **Writes only when the name has an OPEN row** (and `--dry-run` is absent); if its only row is a *closed*
  cycle (or no row exists) it is **print-only** — we never write RDAP results onto a closed cycle.
- `--dry-run` — compute + print the tally, write nothing.
- Prints a per-run summary: `verify: processed=N dropped=a redemption=b pending_delete=c grace=d
  renewed=e reregistered=f errors=g`; when the due backlog exceeded `--limit`, a `log()` line names how many
  rows were left for the next run; and when any unmatched status strings were seen, a line lists them with
  counts (feeds real-data confirmation #2).

---

## Config & dependency changes

- **`pyproject.toml`:** `dependencies = ["httpx", "truststore", "wordfreq", "whodap"]` (4th runtime dep).
- **`criteria.toml`** — extend `[rdap]` (the `endpoint` + `max_requests_per_sec` keys already exist):
  ```toml
  [rdap]
  endpoint = "https://rdap.verisign.com/com/v1/"
  max_requests_per_sec = 1.0
  concurrency = 5
  max_retries = 4
  timeout = 15.0
  user_agent = "DomainScout/0.1 (personal expired-domain research)"

  [rdap.recheck_days]        # per-status re-verify cadence (verified_at staleness)
  pending_delete = 1
  redemption = 2             # also covers pending-restore rows (classified as redemption)
  grace = 7                  # also covers hold-without-RGP rows (classified as grace)
  dropped = 7
  # 'unknown' intentionally absent -> always due (0 d). No 'expiring' key: Phase 4 never emits it
  # (see transition notes); any missing status falls back to always-due via _is_due.
  ```
- **`config.py`:** add to `Criteria` (all with sane defaults when keys are absent, for backward-compat):
  `rdap_concurrency: int = 5`, `rdap_max_retries: int = 4`, `rdap_timeout: float = 15.0`,
  `rdap_user_agent: str = "DomainScout/0.1 (personal expired-domain research)"`,
  `rdap_recheck_days: dict[str, int]` (parsed from `[rdap.recheck_days]`; default the table above).
  Existing `rdap_endpoint` / `rdap_max_rps` are unchanged.

## Testing strategy (TDD: red → green → commit per task)

- **`parse_observation`** — fixtures built via `DomainResponse.from_json`: redemption, pendingDelete,
  auto-renew, plain-active; plus `None` (404) → `available=True`. Assert normalized status, events dict,
  `expiry_date`, and `status_json`.
- **`next_state` transition matrix** (the auditable core) — **all 7 rows**, with special attention to:
  the two closures (`dropped` + 200 → `reregistered`; lapsing/`unknown` + plain-200 → `renewed`);
  any-open + 404 → `dropped` with `drop_date_actual = today`; **`pending restore` → `redemption` (stays OPEN)**;
  **hold-without-RGP → `grace` (stays OPEN)**; and the ordering edge **`current='dropped'` + 200-on-hold →
  `reregistered`** (row 5 beats row 6, so a re-registration-on-hold still closes).
- **`unmatched_statuses`** — a status list mixing known noise + a novel string returns only the novel string;
  an all-known list returns `()`.
- **Drop-date math** — redemption → `today + 35 d` (and event-anchored when an RGP event date is present);
  pendingDelete → `today + 5 d`; grace → `today + 45 d` (anchored on today, **not** the auto-renewed expiry);
  active/renewed → est cleared. A regression test pins that grace does **not** use `expiry_date`.
- **`_is_due` cadence** — `verified_at is None` ⇒ due; within cadence ⇒ not due; past cadence ⇒ due;
  `unknown`/missing status (incl. `expiring`) ⇒ always due.
- **`TokenBucket` / `with_backoff`** — injected fake `sleep`/clock: bucket paces to `rate`; backoff **retries
  `RateLimitError` / `BadStatusCode` / `httpx.TransportError`** with exponential delays and gives up after
  `max_retries`; **does NOT retry `NotFoundError` or `MalformedQueryError`** (they surface immediately).
- **`select_due`** — temp DB: excludes closed rows, excludes `filter_pass=0`, applies cadence, honors `--limit`,
  and **orders `feed_category='dropped'` rows first** (pin: with all `drop_date_est` NULL, a dropped-feed row
  outranks an expired-feed row), then soonest-drop / never-verified.
- **`verify_candidates` orchestrator** — injected fake `lookup` + fake `doh` (**zero network**): writes the
  RDAP/DoH fields per row via `set_rdap_result`; a fake 404 sets `drop_date_actual`; re-run within cadence
  no-ops; `--recheck-all` reprocesses; `--dry-run` writes nothing; a per-row exception counts as `error` and
  does not abort the batch; **unmatched status strings accumulate into `VerifyCounts.unmatched`**; a
  beyond-`--limit` backlog sets `left_for_next_run`.
- **DB migration** — `init_db` on a pre-Phase-4 schema adds `dns_status` idempotently (PRAGMA path).
- **`set_rdap_result`** — writes the RDAP/DoH columns; `drop_date_actual` COALESCE preserves the first
  non-null; leaves `filter_*` / scoring columns untouched.
- **CLI** — `verify --db <tmp> --dry-run` on a seeded DB prints the summary and writes nothing;
  **`--domain` on a name whose only row is a *closed* cycle is print-only** (asserts no write); a live
  `--domain` smoke test is **marked and skipped by default** (the only network-touching test).
- **No network** in the default suite — every RDAP/DoH path is exercised through injected fakes or fixtures.

## Build-time real-data confirmations (per "test each phase with real data")

1. **Live single-domain smoke** — `verify --domain <a-known-registered .com>` and `--domain <a-known-available
   .com>` against Verisign through the truststore client: confirm 200-parse and 404→`available`, and that the
   MITM TLS path works async exactly as it did for Phase-2 ingest.
2. **Small real batch** — run `verify --limit 25` on real Phase-3 survivors; eyeball the status distribution
   (how many redemption / pendingDelete / grace / renewed / already-dropped), spot-check a few computed
   `drop_date_est` values against the RDAP `events`/`status`, confirm the rate-limiter paces politely, and
   **read the unmatched-status tally** — it tells us empirically which status strings Verisign actually emits
   for our feed population, so any surprise shows up as a number rather than as a silently-closed row.
3. **Idempotency + cadence** — re-run immediately: within-cadence rows are skipped (no RDAP calls); `dns_status`
   recorded alongside; `--recheck-all` re-verifies. Confirm a re-registered example (if any) closes correctly.

## Self-review

- **Placeholders:** none — every default (concurrency 5, limit 1000, cadence days, `GRACE_EST_DAYS = 45` with a
  hard floor of 35) is a stated, tunable config/constant value; the RGP offsets (35 d / 5 d) are the fixed
  ICANN registry tail from §4.4.
- **Consistency:** reuses the Phase-2 truststore client pattern (async twin) and the Phase-3 single-authority
  `init_db` migration + UPDATE-only writer pattern; the 7-row transition table matches §5's open-cycle closure
  rules (`dropped` OPEN; close only on `reregistered`/`renewed`/`dismissed`); `pending restore` and
  hold-without-RGP are kept OPEN per the owner decisions (2026-07-15); `select_due` verifies dropped-feed rows
  first (restored Phase-3-era agreement); DoH is recorded-only per the locked decision; no scoring-column writes
  (Phase 5 boundary intact). Grace estimate, its hard floor, and the removed dead `expiring` cadence key are all
  internally consistent across the code block, table, config, and this review.
- **Scope:** one phase — RDAP verify + lifecycle/drop-date + cadence + DoH-signal + persistence + CLI; no AI /
  toxicity / comps bleed-in.
- **Isolation:** pure logic (`next_state`, drop-date, `_is_due`, `parse_observation`) is network-free and fully
  fixture-tested; async I/O (`lookup_one`, `verify_candidates`, `doh.probe`, `TokenBucket`) is injected into the
  orchestrator so the whole phase tests with zero network; whodap's statefulness is contained by the
  one-client-per-worker pool.

## Build notes (2026-07-15)

Built via the 11-task TDD plan (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-15-phase-4-rdap-verification.md`). **141 automated
tests pass, zero network in the suite** (all RDAP/DoH paths exercised through injected fakes/fixtures), **plus 1
skipped live smoke** (`test_live_smoke_known_registered_and_available` in `tests/test_rdap.py`, marked
`@pytest.mark.skip` — run manually against Verisign RDAP).

**Live-smoke confirmation (real-data confirmations #1–#3, run manually 2026-07-15):** `verify --domain` and a seeded
batch `verify` against `rdap.verisign.com/com/v1/`, through this box's TLS-intercepting proxy via the truststore async
client — all worked, exactly as designed:
- `google.com` → `available=False`, status `['client update prohibited', 'client transfer prohibited',
  'client delete prohibited', 'server update prohibited', 'server transfer prohibited', 'server delete prohibited']`,
  `lifecycle_status='renewed'` (plainly registered → recovered/closed per row 7), `expiry_date=2028-09-13`,
  `dns_status='noerror'`.
- `qzxkvbnmplkjhgfd.com` (unregistered) → `available=True` (RDAP 404), `lifecycle_status='dropped'`,
  `drop_date_actual` set to today, `dns_status='nxdomain'`.
- `example.com` → registered, `expiry_date=2026-08-13`, `lifecycle_status='renewed'`, `dns_status='noerror'`.
- **Seeded batch** (`verify --limit 5` over 2 open `filter_pass=1` rows): summary `processed=2 dropped=1 renewed=1
  errors=0`; DB writeback correct — the 404 row got `lifecycle_status='dropped'` + `drop_date_actual` set; the
  registered row got `renewed` + `expiry_date` + `dns_status` + `verified_at`.
- **`KNOWN_STATUSES` — no additions needed.** Every status string observed on this sample was already in the set;
  zero entries landed in the unmatched-status tally. A larger real batch (`--limit 25`+ on the live Phase-3
  backlog) remains the fuller empirical check per the design's confirmation #2, but the sample run surfaced no
  surprises.
- TLS-through-MITM works async exactly as it did for Phase-2 ingest — no new truststore issues.
- **Drop-offset anchoring reality confirmed:** as anticipated in the transition-table notes, Verisign's `events`
  array did not carry a `redemption period` / `pending delete` phase-start date on the observed responses — it
  omits RGP phase-start events. So in practice `_drop_after`/`next_state` always fall back to the `today`
  (observation-date) anchor for `redemption`/`pending_delete`/`grace` estimates, exactly as the design's
  event-preferred-else-today fallback intended; the event-anchored branch is exercised only by the fixture tests,
  not yet by a real Verisign response.
